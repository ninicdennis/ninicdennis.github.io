    <h1 id="title">Vinyl Setup</h1>
    
      
    <nav id="TableOfContents"></nav>
    <p>Afternoon,</p>
<p>Today, I thought it would be a great idea to share my audio equipment. I happen to love audio equipment quite a bit, and would say that music is a big part of my life. Now, Vinyl is one of the most unconventional way to listen to music, but the whole experience is a great treat, forcing you to listen to the music. I love the whole process and everything about it, and would love to share it.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/Stand.jpg" alt="Setup"></p>
<p>I had to put in some keyboard stuff, as that is my other hobby!</p>
<h1 id="speakers---kef-q150">Speakers - Kef Q150</h1>
<p>I had gotten my start with audio equipment from a buddy at a local best buy. He was in charge of the high end audio equipment, and he showed me a wonderful pair of headphones, the Audeze LCD-2, and I was instantly in love. I never knew how much of a difference there was in music. After a little bit, I wanted a break from headphones and get a set of speakers. That is when I heard his KEF Q150&rsquo;s, and was absolutely blown away. The high range these can handle are quite insane. Beautiful highs, amazing mids, but lack a little bit in the lows. Which I found quite alright as I don&rsquo;t like to blast my music. I chose to mount these above my head, which does raise the sound stage above me, but I still love them. the Uni-Q driver array, putting the tweeter and mid in one spot was absolutely brilliant, and I am now a KEF fanboy. I hope to own a set of their floorstanding speakers one day!</p>

<h1 id="amp---smsl-ad18">Amp - SMSL AD18</h1>
<p>For the amp, I had picked up an SMSL AD18. I wanted something that I could just keep on my desk, and take up minimal space. This little guy has no problem driving both kefs, at a pretty high volume as well. I believe it was 80 watt a channel, which is incredible for the size! I have this little guy hooked up to my turntable, as well as my computer, and can easily switch between the two right in front of me.</p>

<p>Dont mind the cables!</p>
<h1 id="turntable---technics-sl-q300">Turntable - Technics SL-Q300</h1>
<p>This Technics turntable was a hand-me-down from my father, who recently found a newer model technics turntable. He has been using this thing for a while now, and it was a sweet little system! From what I understand, it was pretty rare to find these with a clear cover thats not fogged up, so its in better of a condition.</p>

<p>Listening to: Cosmo Shelldrake</p>
<p>All in all, this is a great little setup, and I am quite proud of it. The only real change I need to make is to get a better grounding cable, and a different Composite cable as this one is buzzing a little bit. But I am happy to start listening to my collection, as it has been almost half a year of collecting without actually being able to listen! So I am very Excited! I plan to also hook up my big tube amp to it as well, so I can take the occasional listen with my cans!</p>

<p>I am a huge Nujabes fan, I am happy I can finally listen to these!</p>
