      <description>Afternoon,
Today, I thought it would be a great idea to share my audio equipment. I happen to love audio equipment quite a bit, and would say that music is a big part of my life. Now, Vinyl is one of the most unconventional way to listen to music, but the whole experience is a great treat, forcing you to listen to the music. I love the whole process and everything about it, and would love to share it.</description>

      <description>Afternoon,
For the past few months, I have been wanting to get into game development for quite some time. It was one of my passions as a kid, but I never thought I could do it until now.

      <description>Afternoon,
I thought as an Initial post I would create a post talking about my development gear.

As a tl;dr, here is a simple rundown:</description>

      <description>Afternoon,
Today, I wanted to talk about a future plan I have going on right now. Recently, I had found a Dell R640 for VERY cheap, but my main issue is where the server rack is located, I can not have it running at certain times, as it is very very loud. I am currently in the process of moving this specific server to a place where noise wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an issue.</description>
